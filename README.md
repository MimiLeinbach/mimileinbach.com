# Mimi Leinbach Website

This portfolio site was developed through collaborative coding in Cursor with Claude 3 Sonnet, an Anthropic LLM. The project demonstrates how AI can be effectively used as a programming partner while maintaining full developer control over architecture and design decisions.

## Technical Implementation
Built with React and modern CSS, the site features responsive design, component-based architecture, and clean, maintainable code.
