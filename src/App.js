                <h2>AI Product Leader</h2>
                <p>I'm an AI Product Leader who drives measurable outcomes at enterprise scale through systematic product strategy and operational excellence. At SAP SuccessFactors, I led AI-powered product experiences serving 26 million users across 10,000+ enterprise customers, achieving 12% satisfaction improvement and contributing to 31% NPS growth across the $2B platform.</p>
                <p>My competitive advantage is bridging product innovation with operational execution. I built systematic frameworks for enterprise feature rollouts that reduced time-to-adoption by 50%, ensuring AI features moved efficiently from opt-in to universal deployment across thousands of customers. After leading products from zero-to-one startups to global enterprise platforms, I've learned that successful AI products require both technical innovation and disciplined operational frameworksâ€”which is why my products consistently deliver measurable business impact.</p>
