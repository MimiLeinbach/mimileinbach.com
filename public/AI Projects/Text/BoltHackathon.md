**Bolt Hackathon: Collaborative Trip Planning Platform**

**Project Overview**

This project is a collaboration among three people working remotely. I managed the Github repository and deployment and built the home page, trip creation, responsive web features. 

Junto is a modern web application that enables groups to collaboratively plan trips together. Built as a comprehensive solution for shared travel planning, it allows multiple users to create itineraries, add activities, and coordinate group adventures in real-time.
