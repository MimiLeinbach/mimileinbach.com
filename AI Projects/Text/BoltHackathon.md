## **AI Itinerary \- Collaborative Trip Planning Platform**

Hackathon Project | Team of 3 | React \+ TypeScript

### **Overview**

AI Itinerary is a responsive web application designed to streamline collaborative group trip planning. Built during a hackathon with a distributed team of three developers, the platform enables friends to seamlessly coordinate travel plans through real-time collaboration and intuitive design.

### **Key Features**

* Trip Creation & Management: Users can create trips with customizable dates, destinations, and participant counts  
* Dynamic Itinerary Generation: Automatically generates day-by-day views based on trip duration  
* Collaborative Activity Planning: Team members can add, edit, and join activities with location, timing, and cost tracking  
* Real-time Collaboration: Shareable links enable instant team collaboration without authentication barriers  
* Cost Management: Automatic calculation of per-participant expenses and trip totals  
* Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach ensuring seamless experience across all devices

### **Technical Implementation**

* Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience  
* State Management: Zustand for lightweight, scalable state management  
* Routing: React Router for seamless navigation  
* Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom design system featuring adventure-themed aesthetics  
* Data Persistence: Local storage with shareable link functionality for MVP deployment  
* Architecture: Modular component structure designed to minimize merge conflicts in team development

### **Team Collaboration**

My Role: Lead developer for trip creation and management features

* Architected the core trip data structure and state management  
* Implemented form validation and user experience flows  
* Designed the foundational component library for team consistency

Collaborative Strategy: Structured codebase with clear separation of concerns to enable parallel development without version control conflicts, allowing three developers to work simultaneously on different features.

### **Technical Highlights**

* Zero-authentication MVP using shareable links and local storage  
* Real-time state synchronization across multiple browser sessions  
* Responsive design system with consistent spacing and typography  
* Performance-optimized with lazy loading and efficient re-renders

### **Impact**

Delivered a fully functional MVP within hackathon timeframe, demonstrating ability to rapidly prototype, collaborate effectively in distributed teams, and create user-centered solutions under tight deadlines.
